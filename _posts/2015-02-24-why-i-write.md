title: Why I write
date: 2015-02-24

I was recently filled with existential dread when I had to fill out an application for a master's program. The source was a question. It wasn't framed as a question, but it was one nonetheless. I don't know if you've ever had to write a statement of purpose and explain to someone what makes you unique, but for me it was not fun. It felt like I had to copy from George Orwell, or Stephen King and convince them I had things to share, knowledge they didn't posess. Or at least the ability to find that knowledge. The qualification for the writing always comes first. I don't know if I am unique, or if I have anything to share and I'll hesitate instead of putting myself out there. Who cares if the writing isn't beautiful? Maybe I won't find that knowledge. In high school, for my final paper for English the only thing my teacher had given me a tick for was a line that my friend had offered me to use. But that didn't stop me. I guess none of that really matters in the end. I'll get the qualifications out of the way now so that when feel like I have something to write about I will write about it. Because that's why I write. I want to.
