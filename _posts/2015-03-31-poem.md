Some days I wished

to give my life

away. When other kids

were wishing for toys.

I could never fit

with their gifts.

With a book I asked

if I could slip myself

inbetween the pages. I could be

your bookmark.

I tried once

to give my life away

in a dream,

a man with scales

measured me.

He said "You

are."

And I knew

How I weighed up

and up

floating higher

cut.
